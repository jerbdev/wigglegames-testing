# Welcome to the Wiggle Games Testing Repository

Welcome to the testing repository for **Wiggle Games**. This repository contains the essential components for the development and testing of our fun and interactive games. Here, you’ll find code, test scripts, and documentation to help you get started.

## Overview

This repository is designed to help developers and testers alike understand the structure of the Wiggle Games application. The code is organized into two main Python files: `main.py` and `api.py`.

### main.py

The `main.py` file serves as the entry point for the Wiggle Games application. Here’s what you need to know:

- **Purpose**: This file initializes the game environment, sets up the game loop, and manages the overall gameplay.
- **Functionality**: You'll find functions related to game setup, handling user input, and rendering the game graphics. The main game logic resides here, making it the core of our game experience.
- **How to Run**: Simply run the command `python main.py` in your terminal to start the game. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate and play.

### api.py

The `api.py` file handles the interaction between the game and any external services or data repositories we may use. Key points include:

- **Purpose**: This file manages communication with APIs and services that provide data for the games, such as scores, player profiles, or game assets.
- **Functionality**: Within `api.py`, you’ll find functions for sending requests to APIs, retrieving data, and processing responses. This file ensures that our games can integrate seamlessly with online resources.
- **How to Integrate**: When modifying or extending game functionality that relies on external data, make adjustments in `api.py` to manage those data flows effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Wiggle Games testing repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Use the command `git clone <repository-url>` to get a copy on your local machine.
2. **Install dependencies**: Make sure to install any required packages. You can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if a requirements file is provided.
3. **Run the game**: Start by running `main.py` to experience the game firsthand.

## Customizing Snek

Here are three exciting ways to personalize your experience with the `Snek`:

### 1. Change Game Speed
- Modify the `self.snake_speed` attribute in the code to adjust how fast the snake moves. Experiment with increasing speed as the snake grows for added challenge!

### 2. Change Colors
- Adjust the RGB values for the color attributes like `black`, `green`, and `blue` to redefine the game's color palette. Create a unique visual theme that suits your style!

### 3. Change Snake Block Size
- Alter the `self.snake_block` value to increase or decrease the size of the snake’s segments. This change can significantly impact the game's dynamics, making it more engaging.

Feel free to explore these options and create your unique version of Snek!
